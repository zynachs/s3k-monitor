# Documentation

## Overview

This repository consists of mainly two applications: *monitor* and *app*. The monitor is the core of this project while the app is an application which will be used to test the functionality of the monitor. 

>The purpose of the monitor is to be the first user-level process in the s3k kernel which will be responsible for *monitoring* all other user processes. The responsibilities of the monitor will be to authenticate the code of other processes, load the processes into memory, handling their capabilities to time and memory and handle certain exceptions.

**For information about the monitor see [project-proposal.md](./project-proposal.md)**

## Quick start

If you are not interested in building the project from source, prebuilt releases are available on [Github](https://github.com/zynachs/s3k-monitor/releases). Instructions are provided in the release notes.

## Dependencies and compatibility

> **NOTE FROM DEVELOPER:** The development environment for this repository is Ubuntu Linux on [WSL](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wsl/install). It should be compatible with most Linux distributions but names of dependencies might differ.

### Required software:

| Software | Version | Source | Note | 
| --- | --- | --- | --- | 
| git | N/A | https://git-scm.com/ | - | 
| kth-step/s3k | commit: c0b7800 | https://github.com/kth-step/s3k/commit/c0b78005261f4725be71e103f70e61b0a8a2fee2 | Only tested and compatible with the specified commit of s3k. |

To build, test and run the project there are two options. Option 1 is the recommended solution since it is simpler and quicker to get started. 

#### Option 1

With option 1, the project is built and run within a docker container and thus requires docker. A prebuilt image is provided on [Github](https://github.com/users/zynachs/packages/container/package/s3k-monitor-cc) and it includes all the tools used to build and run the project. You can also build your own docker image with the provided [Dockerfile](./Dockerfile).

| Software | Version | Source | Note | 
| --- | --- | --- | --- | 
| Docker | N/A | https://www.docker.com/ | - | 

#### Option 2

With option 2, the project is built and run with tools on your native system. The required tools are accessible through package managers. 

| Software | Version | Source | Note | 
| --- | --- | --- | --- | 
| GNU Make | N/A | https://www.gnu.org/software/make/ | - |
| GNU Compiler | N/A | https://gcc.gnu.org/ | Standard compiler for native target. |
| Python 3 | N/A | https://www.python.org/ | - |
| RISC-V GNU Compiler Toolchain **\*** | tag: 2023.02.21 | https://github.com/riscv-collab/riscv-gnu-toolchain/releases/tag/2023.02.21 | Only tested the specified version and compiled from source. Version in package manager might be outdated. |
| QEMU **\*** | Release: 7.2.0 | https://github.com/qemu/qemu/releases/tag/v7.2.0 | Only tested the specified version and compiled from source. Version in package manager might be outdated. |

> **\*** **WARNING:** Usage of the package manager versions of *RISC-V GNU Compiler Toolchain* and *QEMU* has resulted in bugs since they are outdated (according to the developers experience). Therefore we recommend building these tools from source with newer versions. The specified versions below have been used by the developers and are also used in the docker solution, see [Option 1](#option-1). Building these tools from source is a time consuming process and also error prone since the tools themselves have dependencies which if not present will omit functionality of the tools. 

## Compiling and running

> This repository **DEPENDS** on and expects that it resides in the same parent folder as [kth-step/s3k](https://github.com/kth-step/s3k).

1. Clone both repositories.
2. Checkout kth-step/s3k to commit `c0b78005261f4725be71e103f70e61b0a8a2fee2`

```shell
git clone https://github.com/zynachs/s3k-monitor.git
git clone https://github.com/kth-step/s3k.git
cd s3k && git checkout c0b7800
```

4. Install prerequisite packages and tools.

```shell
# example installation with apt package manager
apt update && apt install -y git make build-essential python3
```

> [Option 2:](#option-2) build tools from source or install from package manager.
> ```shell
> # example installation with apt package manager
> apt update && apt install -y gcc-riscv64-unknown-elf qemu-system-misc
> ```

5. Compile kernel, monitor and app.

> [Option 1:](#option-1) execute make commands in container via [run.sh](./run.sh). Image is automatically downloaded from [Github](https://github.com/users/zynachs/packages/container/package/s3k-monitor-cc) if it does not exist locally.
> ```shell
> cd /path/to/s3k-monitor
> ./run.sh all # equivalent to "make all" 
> ```

> [Option 2:](#option-2) execute make commands with native tools.
> ```shell
> cd /path/to/s3k-monitor
> make all
> ```

6. Execute kernel, monitor and app with qemu and launch a GDB live debugging session.

> [Option 1:](#option-1)
> ```shell
> cd /path/to/s3k-monitor
> ./run.sh # equivalent to "make run" 
> ```

> [Option 2:](#option-2)
> ```shell
> cd /path/to/s3k-monitor
> make run
> ```

### Optional notes

#### Build docker image locally

> Build duration >1h. May vary depending on internet speeds and system resources.  
> Image size ~2.5GB
 
```shell
cd /path/to/s3k-monitor
docker build -t s3k-monitor-cc:local .
```

#### Download docker image manually

> Image size ~2.5GB
```shell
docker pull ghcr.io/zynachs/s3k-monitor-cc:latest
```

#### Change configuration for testing
To change testing parameters of the project edit [config.h](./config.h). Instructions provided in comments.

#### Modify persistent GDB breakpoints
Initial breakpoints are set in [tools/breakpoints.txt](./tools/breakpoints.txt). Write one breakpoint per line and ONLY the value of the breakpoint: i.e. `app.c:loop` or `*0x80020000`, **NOT** `break app.c:loop` or `break *0x80020000`.

### User guide

The project is emulated on qemu and interacted with over a live GDB session. This is all wrapped up inside a tmux session which is created by the script [qemu.sh](./tools/qemu.sh). 

#### Demo

![user-guide](./img/user-guide.gif)

#### Instructions

* When the project is run it will spawn a tmux session in the current terminal.
* The first page is a help page with some useful information.
* Switch to the main page with `ctrl+b (release) n`. use the same keystroke to switch to the help page.
* The left panel contains GDB in tui mode.
* The right panel displays output from kernel, monitor and app.
* Restart the session with `ctrl+b (release) r`.
* Exit session with `ctrl+b (release) d`.
* **Note:** `ctrl+c` will not exit tmux, it will interact with the application in the current pane/window as expected.

## Memory layout

The kernel does not use virtual memory and does not have an MMU. It uses physical memory addresses and MPU (Memory Protection Unit).

>The s3k kernel is emulated on QEMU's builtin *virt* hardware board. The following information is dependant on this virtual hardware.

# Instructions for tester

This section describes how you can test that the project works as intended.

## Getting started

Make sure that you can run the project as described in the [user guide](#user-guide)

## Test 0

### Summary

| Test | Description | broken signature | valid signature |
| ---- | ----------- | ----------- | ------------ |
| 0 | Load app with a broken/valid signature. | Authentication failed -> app not loaded | Authentication success -> app loaded |

### Guide 

1.

## Tests 1-4

### Summary

| Test | Description | SECURITY off | SECURITY on |
| ---- | ----------- | ----------- | ------------ |
| 1 | App attempts to write outside process memory. | Exception -> soft-reset | Exception -> soft-reset |
| 2 | App attempts to execute outside process memory. | Exception -> soft-reset | Exception -> soft-reset |
| 3 | App attempts to write to code. | No exception. No output. | Exception -> soft-reset |
| 4 | App attempts to execute from data. | No exception. Output: "Executing from data!" | Exception -> soft-reset |

### Guide

1. Edit [config.h](./config.h)
   * **comment** `#define TEST_MASK 0x0` and **uncomment** `#define TEST_MASK 0x01E`
   * **comment** `#define SECURITY` is **uncommented** and 
2. Check that `#define SIG_BROKEN` (this disables the security).
3. Run the project `./run.sh` or `make run`. (This will detect the changes in `config.h` and recompile relevant parts)
4. Switch to the main page and enter `c` in the GDB prompt to continue execution.
5. In the output screen you should see `SECURITY off` and `TESTS: 0x1 0x2 0x3 0x4` according to <a href="#figure-1">figure 1</a>.

> <img src="./img/test1-4-a.jpg" alt="figure 1">
> <a id="figure-1"><i>Figure 1</i></a>

6. Enter `c` twice. The output will now show that the app has run the first and second tests. Both tests resulted in a exception which the app could not resolve and was forced to soft-reset and move on to the next test.

> In the first test the app attempt to write outside of process memory (see `eval`). Even though security is off the app is not allowed to write outside of its allocated memory. See yellow-highlighted parts in <a href="#figure-2">figure 2.</a>
> <br><br>
> In the second test the app attempt to execute from outside of process memory (see `eval` and `epc`). This is not allowed even if security is off similarly to the first test. See green-highlighted parts in <a href="#figure-2">figure 2.</a>
> <br><br>
> <img src="./img/test1-4-b.jpg" alt="figure 2">
> <a id="figure-2"><i>Figure 2</i></a>

7. Enter `c` twice followed by `ctrl+c`. The output will now show that the app has run the third and fourth tests.

> In the third test the app attempted to write to an executable memory segment. No exception occurred because the app is given RWX permissions to its memory since security is off in the monitor. See yellow-highlighted parts in <a href="#figure-3">figure 3.</a> The address written to was `0x80021800` and it is within the `.text` section intended for code, see <a href="#memory-layout">memory layout</a>. Enter `x/4bx 0x80021800` to see what was written (restart the session with `ctrl+b (release) r` and inspect the memory before and after the third test).
> <br><br>
> In the fourth test the app attempted to execute from a data memory segment. No exception occurred due to the same reason described in the third test. The code which was executed printed "Executing from data!" which can be seen in the output. See green-highlighted parts in <a href="#figure-3">figure 3.</a>
> <br><br>
> <img src="./img/test1-4-c.jpg" alt="figure 3">
> <a id="figure-3"><i>Figure 3</i></a>

8. Exit the debugger with `ctrl+b (release) d`.
9. Edit [config.h](./config.h)
   * **uncomment** `#define SECURITY`
10. Run the tests again. The first and second test will give the same result, but now the third and fourth test will both generate exceptions which the app cannot resolve which forces it to soft-reset.

> When security is on in the monitor it enforces the write xor execute policy in the app's memory which now results in exceptions in the third and fourth test as expected. See yellow-highlighted parts for the third test's output and green-highlighted parts for the fourth test's output in <a href="#figure-4">figure 4.</a>
> <br><br>
> <img src="./img/test1-4-d.jpg" alt="figure 4">
> <a id="figure-4"><i>Figure 4</i></a>

## Tests 5-7

### Summary

| Test | Description | SECURITY off | SECURITY on |
| ---- | ----------- | ----------- | ------------ |
| 5 | App attempts to write data to heap. | No exception. No output | Exception -> memory set to RW |
| 6 | App attempts to execute data written to heap. | No exception. Output: "Executing from NEW code!" | Exception -> successfully authenticated code. Output: "Executing from NEW code!" |
| 7 | App attempts to execute new code with broken signature. | No exception. Output: "Executing from NEW code!" | Exception -> memory set to RW -> exception -> unsuccessfully authenticated code -> soft-reset |
