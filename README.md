# Documentation

## Overview

This repository consists of mainly two applications: *monitor* and *app*. The monitor is the core of this project while the app is an application which will be used to test the functionality of the monitor. 

>The purpose of the monitor is to be the first user-level process in the s3k kernel which will be responsible for *monitoring* all other user processes. The responsibilities of the monitor will be to authenticate the code of other processes, load the processes into memory, handling their capabilities to time and memory and handle certain exceptions.

**For information about the monitor see [project-proposal.md](./project-proposal.md)**

## Quick start

If you are not interested in building the project from source, prebuilt releases are available on [Github](https://github.com/zynachs/s3k-monitor/releases). Instructions are provided in the release notes.

## Dependencies and compatibility

> **NOTE FROM DEVELOPER:** The development environment for this repository is Ubuntu Linux on [WSL](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wsl/install). It should be compatible with most Linux distributions but names of dependencies might differ.

### Required software:

| Software | Version | Source | Note | 
| --- | --- | --- | --- | 
| git | N/A | https://git-scm.com/ | - | 
| kth-step/s3k | commit: c0b7800 | https://github.com/kth-step/s3k/commit/c0b78005261f4725be71e103f70e61b0a8a2fee2 | Only tested and compatible with the specified commit of s3k. |

To build, test and run the project there are two options. Option 1 is the recommended solution since it is simpler and quicker to get started. 

#### Option 1

With option 1, the project is built and run within a docker container and thus requires docker. A prebuilt image is provided on [Github](https://github.com/users/zynachs/packages/container/package/s3k-monitor-cc) and it includes all the tools used to build and run the project. You can also build your own docker image with the provided [Dockerfile](./Dockerfile).

| Software | Version | Source | Note | 
| --- | --- | --- | --- | 
| Docker | N/A | https://www.docker.com/ | - | 

#### Option 2

With option 2, the project is built and run with tools on your native system. The required tools are accessible through package managers. 

| Software | Version | Source | Note | 
| --- | --- | --- | --- | 
| GNU Make | N/A | https://www.gnu.org/software/make/ | - |
| GNU Compiler | N/A | https://gcc.gnu.org/ | Standard compiler for native target. |
| Python 3 | N/A | https://www.python.org/ | - |
| RISC-V GNU Compiler Toolchain **\*** | tag: 2023.02.21 | https://github.com/riscv-collab/riscv-gnu-toolchain/releases/tag/2023.02.21 | Only tested the specified version and compiled from source. Version in package manager might be outdated. |
| QEMU **\*** | Release: 7.2.0 | https://github.com/qemu/qemu/releases/tag/v7.2.0 | Only tested the specified version and compiled from source. Version in package manager might be outdated. |

> **\*** **WARNING:** Usage of the package manager versions of *RISC-V GNU Compiler Toolchain* and *QEMU* has resulted in bugs since they are outdated (according to the developers experience). Therefore we recommend building these tools from source with newer versions. The specified versions below have been used by the developers and are also used in the docker solution, see [Option 1](#option-1). Building these tools from source is a time consuming process and also error prone since the tools themselves have dependencies which if not present will omit functionality of the tools. 

## Compiling and running

> This repository **DEPENDS** on and expects that it resides in the same parent folder as [kth-step/s3k](https://github.com/kth-step/s3k).

1. Clone both repositories.
2. Checkout kth-step/s3k to commit `c0b78005261f4725be71e103f70e61b0a8a2fee2`

```shell
git clone https://github.com/zynachs/s3k-monitor.git
git clone https://github.com/kth-step/s3k.git
cd s3k && git checkout c0b7800
```

4. Install prerequisite packages and tools.

```shell
# example installation with apt package manager
apt update && apt install -y git make build-essential python3
```

> [Option 1:](#option-1) install docker according to your [platform.](https://docs.docker.com/engine/install/)

> [Option 2:](#option-2) build tools from source or install from package manager.
> ```shell
> # example installation with apt package manager
> apt update && apt install -y gcc-riscv64-unknown-elf qemu-system-misc
> ```

5. Compile kernel, monitor and app.

> [Option 1:](#option-1) execute make commands in container via [run.sh](./run.sh). Image is automatically downloaded from [Github](https://github.com/users/zynachs/packages/container/package/s3k-monitor-cc) if it does not exist locally.
> ```shell
> cd /path/to/s3k-monitor
> ./run.sh all # equivalent to "make all" 
> ```

> [Option 2:](#option-2) execute make commands with native tools.
> ```shell
> cd /path/to/s3k-monitor
> make all
> ```

6. Execute kernel, monitor and app with qemu and launch a GDB live debugging session.

> [Option 1:](#option-1)
> ```shell
> cd /path/to/s3k-monitor
> ./run.sh # equivalent to "make run" 
> ```

> [Option 2:](#option-2)
> ```shell
> cd /path/to/s3k-monitor
> make run
> ```

### Optional notes

#### Build docker image locally

> Build duration >1h. May vary depending on internet speeds and system resources.  
> Image size ~2.5GB
 
```shell
cd /path/to/s3k-monitor
docker build -t s3k-monitor-cc:local .
```

#### Download docker image manually

> Image size ~2.5GB
```shell
docker pull ghcr.io/zynachs/s3k-monitor-cc:latest
```

#### Change configuration for testing
To change testing parameters of the project edit [config.h](./config.h). Instructions provided in comments.

#### Modify persistent GDB breakpoints
Initial breakpoints are set in [tools/breakpoints.txt](./tools/breakpoints.txt). Write one breakpoint per line and ONLY the value of the breakpoint: i.e. `app.c:loop` or `*0x80020000`, **NOT** `break app.c:loop` or `break *0x80020000`.

### User guide

The project is emulated on qemu and interacted with over a live GDB session. This is all wrapped up inside a tmux session which is created by the script [qemu.sh](./tools/qemu.sh). 

#### Demo

![user-guide](./img/user-guide.gif)

#### Instructions

* When the project is run it will spawn a tmux session in the current terminal.
* The first page is a help page with some useful information.
* Switch to the main page with `ctrl+b (release) n`. use the same keystroke to switch to the help page.
* The left panel contains GDB in tui mode.
* The right panel displays output from kernel, monitor and app.
* Restart the session with `ctrl+b (release) r`.
* Exit session with `ctrl+b (release) d`.
* **Note:** `ctrl+c` will not exit tmux, it will interact with the application in the current pane/window as expected.

## Memory layout

The kernel does not use virtual memory and does not have an MMU. It uses physical memory addresses and MPU (Memory Protection Unit).

>The s3k kernel is emulated on QEMU's builtin *virt* hardware board. The following information is dependant on this virtual hardware.
